- how to make bespoke-data consistent with item type?

- list only point to not list/not curator. (maybe say only to app or group)
- cur page only point to lists
- how to add a default/bunt value in the data type? (we should add it for color, see where else. where for bespoke?)
- how to look for e.g. ships. canonical pointer or canonical title?

%curator type za subscribing, su other curs can be recommended
(samo recommendas curator page)

FIXES AFTER DATA CHANGE
- gens popravit

ARCH
- remove extra files which come from base

SCRYS/SUBS
- all items by ship to FE

VALIDATION!!
- respond-to-update (subs + validator)

ERROR HANDLING?
 - what happens if scries fail? (look where they are all used)
 - make sre you dont !!, but return sth like ~

TESTING
- BOOTAT NEKOLIKO MJESECA ASAP, I TESTIRAT NA LIVE NETWORKU



TODO LATER
 - purges on a daily/weekly basis or sth
 - TODO printove popravit u portal storeu/manageru i u libu da da kazu title a ne samo pointer
   tj da budu i na vise mjesta di trebaju bit (pomoc ce za debugging kad ljudi krenu koristit)
 - make cards from portal.hoon, and almost dont use any from portal-manager/portal-store explicitly
   or is that less clear? or more clear?

mock data commands:
=data -build-file /=portal=/sur/portal/data/hoon
=lib -build-file /=portal=/lib/portal/hoon

=groups-list [%group ~[[%.n ~dilryd-mopreg 'app-store' %group] [%.n ~toptyr-bilder 'random-group' %group] [%.n ~doplyr-harbur 'hacker-house']]]


ADD OTHER
:portal-manager &portal-action [%add our %other *editable-data:data [%other ~]]

ADD APPS
:portal-manager &portal-action [%add our %app *editable-data:data [%app '~zod/portal']]

ADD MIXED LIST FROM ALL ITEMS (except curator page and validity store)
:portal-manager|make-all-list

ADD APPS LIST FROM APPS IN ALL ITEMS
:portal-manager|make-app-list

EDIT CUR-PAGE
:portal-manager|seed-cur-page

SCRIES
.^(item:data %gx /=portal-store=/0/~zod/~2023.1.21..21.25.50..88d0/other/item)

Whatever you add is auto added to your collection (cur=dev)?

how to follow a curator? (e.g. you can find their default %curated easily just by their @p because you know it's '~2000.1.1'

version control such that curator recommends a specific version of it
curator should unrecommend something if it updates?

Curator subs to dev's cur page (change name), receives a list of his items from which he can choose what he puts on his on cur page

extra command for practicality: add pointer to list-of-pointers when you want (so it's like edit item, but specific to the item type)
- in different situations, e.g. auto add a pointer, for all received data for example

specificna mapa/lista itema koji su prikazani? (ako zelis neki hopping algo u buducnosti mozemo)

eventually we want to add "price" property to items.
